Data Abstraction:
                 initializes the arrays and all of the objects uilized in creating
                 the sudoku square 
Input:
                 user inputs the row, col and number they would like to replace 

Process:
                 the program takes the user data reads it and determins if the 
                 square is completed or not 

Output:
                the sudoku square and all of the user inputs are displayed

Assumptions:
                the user will enter a number not already preoccupied 
                the user will enter a valid col and row 
                the user will not edit the numbers allready in the sudoku square
